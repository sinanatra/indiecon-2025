  <h3>Reclaiming the Night Sky</h3>
  <p>
    The presence of the internet is only visible through loading bars, WLAN
    icons and the occasional 404 page. Its actual infrastructure - cables under
    the oceans, servers located in deserts - remains hidden , fuelling the
    illusion of a weightless and, above all, quiet network. But in recent years,
    parts of the internet have begun to (re)manifest themselves above us: loud
    and increasingly impossible to ignore. Our participatory intervention traces
    these signals in orbit, making them visible as both metaphor and material.
    Based on real-time satellite data, it translates the new digital landscape
    into visual noise and printed protest. Between observation and interference,
    between screens and printed matter, the work explores how publishing -
    digital and analogue - can respond to the infrastructures that shape,
    monitor and sometimes disturb our communication.
